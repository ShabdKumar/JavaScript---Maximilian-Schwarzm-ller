// 1. Create two variables: One that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice) and one that holds no value initially (e.g. "result").
const userInput = 10;
let result;

// 2. Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input.
result = userInput + 18;

// 3. Add three additional lines of code where you change the result variable again (by subtracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it).
result -= 18;
result *= 10;
result /= 5;

// 4. Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change?
// Ans => No

// 5. alert() the result and the user input variables (in two separate alert() calls).
alert(result);
alert(userInput);
